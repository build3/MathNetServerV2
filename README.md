This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web
framework for building modern real-time applications.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

## Testing

`make --always-make test`

Simply run `npm test` and all your tests in the `test/` directory will be run.

## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g @feathersjs/cli          # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```
